  %h2 1. Unconfiguring Aeolus

  %p
    To remove all of the configuration data and database entries from an Aeolus server, run the
    %b aeolus-cleanup
    command as a super-user:

  %p
    %pre
      :preserve
        $ sudo /usr/sbin/aeolus-cleanup

  %p
    This is useful for removing Aeolus configuration data from an existing
    server, prior to running <b>aeolus-configure</b>, so is of particular
    interest to testers and developers.

  %p
    It only acts on the local Aeolus server, and does not communicate with
    any configured Cloud providers or stop any currently-running instances.  You need to manually
    remove any information in configured Cloud providers.

  %p
    %b WARNING:
    This command drops the PostgreSQL database, and permanently deletes
    Conductor related data.  Don't use it on a server whose data you want to
    keep.

  %p
    If you are using Amazon EBS, follow the next steps to complete the cleanup.

  %h2 2. Remove any AMIs left in EBS 

  %p
    Aeolus does not yet de-register AMIs, nor delete their corresponding
    storage from EBS.  For now, you will need to use the AWS Management
    Console to de-register AMIs and delete S3 storage yourself.

  %br
  %h3(id="deregistering" style="margin-top:0") 
  %h3 1.1 De-registering an AMI

  %p
    Load Amazons' AWS Management Console, make sure you are in the
    %b EBS
    section, then change to the AMIs page.

  %p
    %ol
      %li Tick the checkbox next to the AMIs created by Aeolus.
      %li
        Click
        %b De-register
        then confirm this is what you want to do.

          :title => "Deregister EC2 AMIs",
          :alt => "Deregister EC2 AMIs" }

  %p
    This removes the selected AMIs from your AMI list.  Their storage needs
    to be removed from EBS next.

  %h3 1.2 Removing EBS storage

  %p
    Load Amazons' AWS Management Console, and make sure you are in the
    %b EBS
    section.

  %p
    %ol
      %li
        Look for any buckets with "<em>imagefactory</em>" in their name, as
        these will have been created by Aeolus.

      %li
        For each of these buckets, delete its contents then delete the bucket
        itself.

    Aeolus has a
    %b much richer
    set of capabilities than what has been shown in this <em>Getting Started
    Guide</em>.
