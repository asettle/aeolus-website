  %h2 1. Unconfiguring Aeolus

  %ol
    %li
      To remove all of the configuration data and database entries from an Aeolus server, run the
      %b aeolus-cleanup
      command as a super-user:

  %p
    %pre
      :preserve
        $ sudo /usr/sbin/aeolus-cleanup

  %p
    This is useful for removing Aeolus configuration data from an existing
    server, prior to running <b>aeolus-configure</b>, so is of particular
    interest to testers and developers.

  %p
    It only acts on the local Aeolus server, and does not communicate with
    any configured Cloud providers or stop any currently-running instances.  You need to manually remove any information in configured Cloud providers.

  .warning
    %p
      %b WARNING:
      This command drops the PostgreSQL database, and permanently deletes
      Conductor related data.  Don't use it on a server whose data you want to
      keep.

  %p
    If you are using Amazon EC2, follow the next steps to complete the cleanup.

  %h2 2. Remove any AMIs left in EC2 

  %p
    Aeolus does not yet de-register AMIs, nor delete their corresponding
    storage from EC2.  For now, you will need to use the AWS Management
    Console to de-register AMIs and delete S3 storage manually.

  %h3 1.1 De-registering an AMI

  %p
    Load Amazons' EC2 Dashboard, make sure you are in the
    %b EBS
    section, then change to the AMIs page.

  %p
    %ol
      %li Tick the checkbox next to the AMIs created by Aeolus.
      %li
        Click
        %b De-register
        then confirm this is what you want to do.

                :alt => "Deregister EC2 AMIs" }

      %li
        This removes the selected AMIs from your AMI list.  Their storage needs to be removed from EBS next.

  %h3 1.2 Removing EBS storage

  %p
    Load Amazons' EC2 Dashboard, and make sure you are in the
    %b EBS
    section.

  %p
    %ol
      %li
        Look for any snapshots with "<em>imagefactory</em>" in their name, as
        these will have been created by Aeolus.

      %li
        For each of these snapshot, delete its contents then delete the snapshot
        itself.
