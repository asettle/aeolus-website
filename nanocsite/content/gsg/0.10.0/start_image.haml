%h1 Start an Instance of the Image

%p
  With the image pushed to your provider account, you can start instances
  when desired.

%p
  We will take you through starting an instance of the image using Aeolus's
  web interface.  Then, if you are using Amazon EC2, we will show you how to connect to that image remotely using
  SSH.

  %h2 1. Create a Catalogue

  %p
    To create a deployable XML file first you must create a catalogue.  

  %p
    %ol
      %li
        In the Aeolus web interface, go to
        %b Administer
        &rArr; <b>Content</b>.

      %li
        Click the "New Catalog" button. Give your catalog a name, associate it with the Default pool, and save it.

      %li
        Click on the name of your new catalog.  

  %p

  %h2 2. Create the Deployable

  %p
    This section dictates the instructions for creating the deployable. Once you have pushed an image to a provider, you are able to create a deployable.
  %ol 
    %li
      Once you have uploaded an image, you want to push this image.
    %li
      While you are pushing this image, there is an option in the right hand corner that says, 'Create Deployable from Image'. Click this.
    %li
      Indicate the name, hardware profile and the catalog then click, save.

    %p

                :alt => "Deployable Image - click to view at full size in a new window" }


    %li
      You will be redirected to the deployable page where you will be able to launch your image.

%h1(id="deployable" style="margin-top:0")

  %h2 3. Creating a Custom Deployable
  
  %p
    You are able to also create a custom deployable.
  %p
    %ol
      %li        
        Click on the New Deployable button.  Give your entry a name, description, and upload the deployable XML file you created.  Save your new deployable.

      %li
        In the Aeolus web interface, go to the
        %b Monitor
        tab.
        %br
        Under "Your Pools" is the default pool. On the right side
        of the default pool there's an arrow. Click the arrow and it will expose the
        button "New Deployment". Click the "New Deployment" button:

        %br

      %li
        Give your deployment a name and upload the deployable you just created.
        Click the
        %b Next
        button where you will begin to launch your deployment.

  %h2 4. Launching a Deployment

  %ol
    %li
      To launch the deployment click the "Launch" button.

    %br
      %center
        %a{ :href => "Images/Start Instance Images/launch_deployment.png",
            :target => "_blank" }

                    :alt => "Launch  Deployment - click to view at full size in a new window" }
      %br

    %li
      Aeolus will then launch an instance of the template, using the AMI
      created on the previous page.
    %li
      The main view will list your instances, with the message
      "<em>Deployment launched.</em>" near the top:

    %li
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      %center
        %a{ :href => "Images/Start Instance Images/instance_added.png",
            :target => "_blank" }
          %img.thumbnail{ :src => "Images/Thumbnails/instance_added_thumb.png",
                :title => "Instance 1 added",
                :alt => "Instance 1 added" }

    %li
      Within a minute or two, the
      %b State
      field for the instance should change to "<em>running</em>". The state will automatically be updated on the page;
      there is no need to refresh the page.

    %li
      If you are using Amazon EC2, follow the next steps to complete your configuration.

  %h2 5. Configure EC2 for SSH Connections

  %p
    By default, Amazon EC2 does not allow network connections to instances.

  %p
    If you want to use SSH with them, it needs to be enabled in the EC2
    Security Groups settings:

  %p
    %ol
      %li
        In the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?#s=SecurityGroups">Amazon AWS Management Console</a>,
        go to
        %b EC2
        &rArr; <b>Security Groups</b>.

      %li
        Click on the
        %b default
        security group.
        %br
        This displays the details for the default security group, in the
        lower part of the window.
        %br
        %br

      %li
        Click on the
        %b Inbound
        tab.

      %li
        For the
        %b Create a new rule
        selector, choose <em>SSH</em>.

      %li
        Click the
        %b Add Rule
        button.

      %li
        Click the
        %b Apply Rule Changes
        button just below it.

  %p
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    %img{ :src => "Images/Start Instance Images/ec2_ssh_rule_added.png",
          :title => "SSH rule added to EC2 default security group",
          :alt => "SSH rule added to EC2 default security group" }

  %p
    EC2 now allows SSH connections to your instances.


%br
%h1(id="connect" style="margin-top:0")
.section-grouping
  %h2 6. Connect to the Instance

  %p
    Now we connect to the new running instance using SSH:

  %p
    %ol
      %li
        Get the public address of the instance from the instance list on the same
        screen the ssh key came from:
        %br
        %br
        %img{ :src => "Images/Start Instance Images/instance_ssh_private_key_download_link.png",
              :title => "Text link to Instance 1 SSH private key",
              :alt => "Text link to Instance 1 SSH private key" }
        %br
        %br

      %li Launch a terminal session on your desktop.

      %li
        In the terminal session, start ssh, passing it the name of the
        private key file for the instance with the "<em>-i</em>" option, giving
        the root user, and giving the public address of the instance:

  %p
    %pre
      :preserve
        $ ssh -i <b>instance_1_private_key.pem</b> root@<b>ec2-67-202-12-174.compute-1.amazonaws.com</b>
        The authenticity of host 'ec2-67-202-12-174.compute-1.amazonaws.com (67.202.12.174)' can't be established.
        RSA key fingerprint is 09:94:bc:be:1c:a0:7c:8b:50:e5:bf:42:8c:cf:86:1b.
        Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
        Warning: Permanently added 'ec2-67-202-12-174.compute-1.amazonaws.com,67.202.12.174' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
        <b>[root@localhost ~]#</b>

  %p
    You are now logged into the running Fedora 16 instance as the root user.

  .note
    %p
      %b IMPORTANT:
      Changes to the file system persist across reboots, but are lost when it
      is shut down.  This means a
      %em yum update
      (then reboot) will be needed each time the instance is started.
