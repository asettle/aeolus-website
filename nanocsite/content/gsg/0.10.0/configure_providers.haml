%h1 Configure Providers

%p
  On this page we configure Aeolus for <b>Mock</b>, a <i>pretend</i>
  Cloud Provider.  It is useful for demonstration and testing purposes.

%p
  This section will configure for EC2 and RHEVM/Ovirt.  This requires an existing Amazon
  AWS account.  You can skip this part if you want.

%p
  We will also configure Audrey Configuration and finally run through the steps of creating a cloud.

  %h2 Which provider would you like to configure?

  %h2 Confirm the Test Provider account exists

  %p
    The test provider is enabled so you can follow this guide without incurring charges from another provider.
  %p
    The test provider account should already exist.  Follow these steps to confirm.

        %em In the Aeolus web interface
        go to
        %b Administer

      %li
        Click "Accounts" just below the choose provider selector.

      %li
        An account name "Testing" should already exist.

  %p
    %ol
      %li
        From the Accounts page, Click the "New Account" button.

      %li
        For
        %b Account name
        use
        "<em>test</em>". For
        %b Username
        use
        "<em>testuser</em>". For
        %b Password
        use
        "<em>testpassword</em>".

%h1(id="ec2" style="margin-top:0") Amazon EC2

.warning
  %b WARNING:
  Amazon and other Cloud providers charge fees for using their products and
  services, including EC2.

  %p
    Setting up EC2 with Aeolus means your Amazon EC2 account will be billed
    with their appropriate usage charges as you follow this guide and/or try
    things out.

  %p
    We
    %b ARE NOT
    responsible for any EC2 or other Cloud fees and charges you may incur.

  %p
    As a precaution after finishing every Aeolus testing session, you
    %b must
    manually check all storage and instances in Amazon have been terminated
    and removed as you expect.

  %p
    Development versions of Aeolus have on occasion been known to report
    instances as stopped when they are in fact still running in EC2, thereby
    incurring charges from Amazon.

  %p
    %b BE CAREFUL!

      Amazon EC2 was automatically populated by the
