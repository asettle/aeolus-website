  %h2(id="mock" style="margin-top:0") Mock - the pretend/test Cloud Provider

  %p
    The mock provider is useful for following this guide without incurring charges from another provider.

  %p
    It was set up automatically when you ran 'aeolus-configure -p mock' earlier.  Follow these steps to confirm it is in place.

  %p
    %ol
      %li
        %em In the Aeolus web interface
        go to
        %b Administer
        &rArr; <b>Cloud Providers</b>.

      %li
        A 'mock' provider should be in the drop down list on the right hand side, as per the screenshot below:

        %p
          %left
            %a{ :href => "Images/Configure Provider Images/testing_image.png",

                    :alt => "Testing Image - click to view at full size in a new window"}

      %li
        Click on it, then click the 'Accounts' tab, under the 'Settings' heading.

      %li
        Verify an account named 'mock' is there.

  %p
    If the account doesn't exist, you can create it by following these steps:
  %p
    %ol
      %li
        From the Accounts page, Click the "New Account" button.
      %li
        For
        %b Account name
        use
        "<em>mock</em>". For
        %b Username
        use
        "<em>mockuser</em>". For
        %b Password
        use
        "<em>mockpassword</em>".

  %h2(id="ec2" style="margin-top:0") Amazon EC2

  .warning
    %b WARNING:
    Amazon and other Cloud providers charge fees for using their products and
    services, including EC2.

    %p
      Setting up EC2 with Aeolus means your Amazon EC2 account will be billed
      with their appropriate usage charges as you follow this guide and/or try
      things out.

    %p
      We
      %b ARE NOT
      responsible for any EC2 or other Cloud fees and charges you may incur.

    %p
      As a precaution after finishing every Aeolus testing session, you
      %b must
      manually check all storage and instances in Amazon have been terminated
      and removed as you expect.

    %p
      Development versions of Aeolus have on occasion been known to report
      instances as stopped when they are in fact still running in EC2, thereby
      incurring charges from Amazon.

    %p
      %b BE CAREFUL!

  %p Follow these steps to configure Amazon EC2 with Aeolus.

  %ol

        Each of seven public Amazon EC2 regions will have been added by
        the
        %em aeolus-configure -p ec2
        command we gave earlier.  Aeolus creates individual provider entries
        for each one:
