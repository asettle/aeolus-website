%h1 Configure Providers

%p
  On this page we configure Aeolus for <b>Mock</b>, a <i>pretend</i>
  Cloud Provider.  It is useful for demonstration and testing purposes. This section will configure EC2, this will require an existing Amazon AWS account. This page will also go through the steps to configure RHEVM/oVirt which will require both RHEVM and oVirt to be set up on a server.

%h1(id="ec2" style="margin-top:0") Amazon EC2

.warning
  %b WARNING:
  Amazon and other Cloud providers charge fees for using their products and
  services, including EC2.

  %p
    Setting up EC2 with Aeolus means your Amazon EC2 account will be billed
    with their appropriate usage charges as you follow this guide and/or try
    things out.

  %p
    We
    %b ARE NOT
    responsible for any EC2 or other Cloud fees and charges you may incur.

  %p
    As a precaution after finishing every Aeolus testing session, you
    %b must
    manually check all storage and instances in Amazon have been terminated
    and removed as you expect.

  %p
    Development versions of Aeolus have on occasion been known to report
    instances as stopped when they are in fact still running in EC2, thereby
    incurring charges from Amazon.

  %p
    %b BE CAREFUL!
