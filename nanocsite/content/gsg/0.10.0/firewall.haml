  %h3(id="firewall") 1. Firewall Configuration

  %p
    For this section you will need to have system-config-firewall-tui installed on your computer. If you do not, use this command line as root user:
  %pre
    :preserve
      yum install system-config-firewall-tui

  %p
    Once the package is installed, you can run the follow instructions from the command line (again as root).

    %ol
      %li
        Open terminal. Type in the line.
      %pre
        :preserve
          system-config-firewall-tui

      %li
        This page will appear:

      %p
        %center
          %a{ :href => "Images/Firewall Images/config_page.png",
              :target => "_blank" }
            %img.thumbnail{ :src => "Images/Thumbnails/config_page_thumb.png",
                  :title => "Configuration Page - click to view at full size in a new window",
                  :alt => "Configuration Page - click to view at full size in a new window" }

      %li
        Use the tab key to select customize. 
      %br
      %li
        The next page will ask you to define which pages are trusted. For this exercise you want to scroll down until you see 'Secure WWW (HTTPS). 
      %br
      %li 
        Press enter to select and use the tab keys to move forward.
      %br
      %li
        The next step will require you to specify which ports you want opened. In this instance, we want port 443: tcp and 443: udp.
      %br
      %li
        Use the tabs keys to select 'add' and enter 443 as the port/port range, and tcp and udp as the protocol. You will have to do these in separate instances.

      %p
        %center
          %a{ :href => "Images/Firewall Images/config_tcp.png",
              :target => "_blank" }
            %img.thumbnail{ :src => "Images/Thumbnails/config_tcp_thumb.png",
                  :title => "TCP Configuration - click to view at full size in a new window",
                  :alt => "TCP Configuration - click to view at full size in a new window" }

      %br
      %li
        Once you have allocated the additional ports, it will appear in the scroll section of the original page. You can see here you have added 443:tcp and 443:udp.
      %br
      %li
        Click forward.
      %br
      %li
        The next few pages will ask you to configure other sections of the firewall. This is unnecessary for this process. Continously click 'forward' until you reach the end page.
      %br

      %li
        Save any content it requires you to save.
      %br
      %li
        Click close.
