%h1 Firewall Configuration

%p
  Firewall configuration can be compiled via a graphic interface and Command Line Interface.
%p
  These are step by step instructions of updating the firewall to configure Aeolus for both a CL and GU interfaces.
%p
  Configuring your firewall to open up port 443 is required for the usage of Aeolus, it does not matter how you chose to do so.

  %h2(id="update-firewall") 1. Update the Firewall via CLI

  %p
    This is a step by step instruction of updating the firewall to configure Aeolus. This is manually required and unless your computer ports are already set up for a secure connection; Aeolus will not function on other ports so this step is imperative.

  %p
    Because Aeolus uses an encrypted web interface, the server running it
    must accept connections on TCP port 443.

  %ol
    %li
      Firstly, update the firewall running on the Aeolus server to allow for thes particular connections.
    %li
      For the standard iptables firewall on Fedora or RHEL, add this line:
    %pre
      :preserve
        -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
    %li
      To both of these files (one is for IPv4, one is for IPv6):

    %p
      %pre
        :preserve
          /etc/sysconfig/iptables
          /etc/sysconfig/ip6tables

    %li
      The correct place is in the
      %b OUTPUT
      chain, just before the
      %b REJECT
      lines start.
    %li
      For example, this is the default
      %em /etc/sysconfig/iptables
      file, with the line added (in blue):

    %p
      %pre
        :preserve
          *filter
          :INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
          :FORWARD ACCEPT [0:0]
          :OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
          -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
          -A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT
          -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
          -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
          <span style="color: blue">-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT</span>
          -A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited
          -A FORWARD -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited
          COMMIT

    %li
      Do the same for the
      %em ip6tables
      file as well.

    %li
      The firewall rules then need to be reloaded:

    %p
      %pre
        :preserve
          $ sudo service iptables restart
          iptables: Flushing firewall rules:                         [  <span style="color: chartreuse">OK</span>  ]
          iptables: Setting chains to policy ACCEPT: nat mangle filte[  <span style="color: chartreuse">OK</span>  ]
          iptables: Unloading modules:                               [  <span style="color: chartreuse">OK</span>  ]
          iptables: Applying firewall rules:                         [  <span style="color: chartreuse">OK</span>  ]

    %p
      %pre
        :preserve
          $ sudo service ip6tables restart
          ip6tables: Flushing firewall rules:                        [  <span style="color: chartreuse">OK</span>  ]
          ip6tables: Setting chains to policy ACCEPT: filter         [  <span style="color: chartreuse">OK</span>  ]
          ip6tables: Unloading modules:                              [  <span style="color: chartreuse">OK</span>  ]
          ip6tables: Applying firewall rules:                        [  <span style="color: chartreuse">OK</span>  ]

    %li
      The Aeolus server now accepts secure connections from a web browser.

    .note
      %p
        %b USEFUL NOTE -
        You can additionally open TCP port 80, for users to attempt connecting
        via standard http.

      %p Aeolus automatically redirects them to the secure port.

  %h2(id="firewall") 2. Update the firewall via GUI

  %p
    For this section you will need to have system-config-firewall-tui installed on your computer. If you do not, use this command line as the root user:
    %pre
      :preserve
        $ sudo yum install system-config-firewall-tui

  %p
    Once the package is installed, you can run the following instructions from the command line (again as root).

    %ol
      %li
        Open a terminal window. Type in the line:
        %pre
          :preserve
            $ sudo system-config-firewall-tui

      %li
        This page will appear:
        %br
        %center
          %img.thumbnail{ :src => "Images/Firewall Images/config_page.png",
                          :title => "Configuration Page", :alt => "Configuration Page" }

      %li
        Use the TAB key to select 'Customize'.
      %br
      %li
        The next page will ask you to define which ports are trusted. For this exercise you want to scroll down until you see '<b>Secure WWW (HTTPS)</b>'.
      %br
      %li
        Press enter to select it, then use the TAB keys to choose 'Close':
        %br
        %center
          %img.thumbnail{ :src => "Images/Firewall Images/secure_www.png",
                          :title => "Secure WWW port", :alt => "Secure WWW port" }

      %li
        This will take you back to the first screen.  Choose the 'OK' option to exit.
      %br
      %li
        Confirm the changes on the next screen to finish.  Firewall configuration is complete.
        %br
        %center
