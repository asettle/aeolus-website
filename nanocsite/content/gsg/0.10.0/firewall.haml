%h1 Firewall Configuration

%p 
  Firewall configuration can be compiled via a graphic interface and Command Line Interface.
%p 
  These are step by step instructions of updating the firewall to configure Aeolus for both a CL and GU interfaces. 
%p
  Configuring your firewall to open up port 443 is required for the usage of Aeolus, it does not matter how you chose to do so.

  %h2(id="update-firewall") 1. Update the Firewall via CLI

  %p
    This is a step by step instruction of updating the firewall to configure Aeolus. This is manually required and unless your computer ports are already set up for a secure connection; Aeolus will not function on other ports so this step is imperative. 

  %p
    Because Aeolus uses an encrypted web interface, the server running it
    must accept connections on TCP port 443.

  %ol
    %li
      Firstly, update the firewall running on the Aeolus server to allow for thes particular connections.
    %li
      For the standard iptables firewall on Fedora or RHEL, add this line: 
    %pre
      :preserve
        -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
    %li
      To both of these files (one is for IPv4, one is for IPv6):

    %p
      %pre
        :preserve
          /etc/sysconfig/iptables
          /etc/sysconfig/ip6tables

    %li
      The correct place is in the
      %b OUTPUT
      chain, just before the
      %b REJECT
      lines start.
    %li
      For example, this is the default
      %em /etc/sysconfig/iptables
      file, with the line added (in blue):

    %p
      %pre
        :preserve
          *filter
          :INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
          :FORWARD ACCEPT [0:0]
          :OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
          -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
          -A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT
          -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
          -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
          <span style="color: blue">-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT</span>
          -A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited
          -A FORWARD -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited
          COMMIT

    %li
      Do the same for the
      %em ip6tables
      file as well.

    %li 
      The firewall rules then need to be reloaded:
  
    %p
      %pre
        :preserve
          $ sudo service iptables restart
          iptables: Flushing firewall rules:                         [  <span style="color: chartreuse">OK</span>  ]
          iptables: Setting chains to policy ACCEPT: nat mangle filte[  <span style="color: chartreuse">OK</span>  ]
          iptables: Unloading modules:                               [  <span style="color: chartreuse">OK</span>  ]
          iptables: Applying firewall rules:                         [  <span style="color: chartreuse">OK</span>  ]

    %p
      %pre
        :preserve
          $ sudo service ip6tables restart
          ip6tables: Flushing firewall rules:                        [  <span style="color: chartreuse">OK</span>  ]
          ip6tables: Setting chains to policy ACCEPT: filter         [  <span style="color: chartreuse">OK</span>  ]
          ip6tables: Unloading modules:                              [  <span style="color: chartreuse">OK</span>  ]
          ip6tables: Applying firewall rules:                        [  <span style="color: chartreuse">OK</span>  ]

    %li
      The Aeolus server now accepts secure connections from a web browser.

    .note
      %p
        %b USEFUL NOTE -
        You can additionally open TCP port 80, for users to attempt connecting
        via standard http.
    
      %p Aeolus automatically redirects them to the secure port.

  %h2(id="firewall") 2. Update the firewall via GUI

  %p
    For this section you will need to have system-config-firewall-tui installed on your computer. If you do not, use this command line as root user:
    %pre
      :preserve
        $ sudo yum install system-config-firewall-tui

  %p
    Once the package is installed, you can run the follow instructions from the command line (again as root).

    %ol
      %li
        Open terminal. Type in the line.
      %pre
        :preserve
          $ sudo system-config-firewall-tui

      %li
        This page will appear:

      %p
        %center
          %a{ :href => "Images/Firewall Images/config_page.png",
              :target => "_blank" }
            %img.thumbnail{ :src => "Images/Thumbnails/config_page_thumb.png",
                  :title => "Configuration Page - click to view at full size in a new window",
                  :alt => "Configuration Page - click to view at full size in a new window" }

      %li
        Use the TAB key to select customize. 
      %br
      %li
        The next page will ask you to define which pages are trusted. For this exercise you want to scroll down until you see 'Secure WWW (HTTPS). 
      %br
      %li 
        Press enter to select and use the TAB keys to move forward.
      %br
      %li
        The next step will require you to specify which ports you want opened. In this instance, we want port 443: tcp.
      %br
      %li
        Use the TAB keys to select 'add' and enter 443 as the port/port range, and tcp and udp as the protocol. You will have to do these in separate instances.

      %p
        %center
          %a{ :href => "Images/Firewall Images/config_tcp.png",
              :target => "_blank" }
            %img.thumbnail{ :src => "Images/Thumbnails/config_tcp_thumb.png",
                  :title => "TCP Configuration - click to view at full size in a new window",
                  :alt => "TCP Configuration - click to view at full size in a new window" }

      %br
      %li
        Once you have allocated the additional ports, it will appear in the scroll section of the original page. You can see here you have added 443:tcp and 443:udp.
      %br
      %li
        Click forward.
      %br
      %li
        The next few pages asks you to configure other sections of the firewall. This is unnecessary for this process. Click Forward until you reach the end page.
      %br

      %li
        Save any required contents.
      %br
      %li
        Click close.
      %p
        %center
          %a{ :href => "Images/Firewall Images/end_config.png",
              :target => "_blank" }
